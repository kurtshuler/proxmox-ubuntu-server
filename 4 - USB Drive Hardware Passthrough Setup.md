# Within the Proxmox node (`pve`):
## Pass through from Proxmox node to VM

1. Plug in the USB drive (duh!)
2. Go to Proxmox GUI node (usually `pve`) and disks to note which drive you want to pass through: `pve --> Disks`
3. Note the VM number you want to pass the disk through to: `[VM-ID]`
4. Enter in `pve` terminal or shell to get list of connected drives by ID. Note the ID for your USB drive: `[DISK-ID]`
   ```shell
   ls -n /dev/disk/by-id/
   ```
5. To pass through drive to your VM:
   ```shell
   /sbin/qm set [VM-ID] -virtio2 /dev/disk/by-id/[DISK-ID]
   ```

   *EXAMPLE:*
   ```shell
   /sbin/qm set 100 -virtio2 /dev/disk/by-id/usb-Micron_CT4000X9SSD9_2332E8DB05F5-0:0
   ```
   
6. Check to see that USB drive was passed through
   ```shell
   more /etc/pve/qemu-server/[VM-ID].conf
   ```

   *EXAMPLE:*
   ```shell
   more /etc/pve/qemu-server/100.conf
   ```

  
# Within the Proxmox GUI VM setup page
## Verify your drive is passed through and turn off backup
> **NOTE:** These steps can only be done after you have created a VM and only affect that VM.
>

1. In Proxmox GUI, verify your disk is passed through to your VM
```
pve â€”> [VM#] â€”> Hardware â€”> Hard Disk
```
2. In Proxmox GUI, double-click your disk and uncheck `Backup`

# Within the running Ubuntu VM:
## Mount the passed-through drive
Set up the mount point and mount the USB drive partition
1. Switch to VM console
2. Find out your passed-through drive partition name (something like `/dev/vda1`)
   > **NOTE:** `vda` is different from `sda`. `vda` is a paravirtualized disk and is faster than an emulated `sda` disk ðŸ˜ƒ.
   ```sh
   lsblk
   ```
3. Create the mount point 
   ```sh
   sudo mkdir /mnt/crucial
   ```
4. Mount the passed-through drive to the VM mount point
   ```sh
   sudo mount /dev/vda1 /mnt/crucial
   ```
5. Verify mount using `df` or `mount` methods
   ```sh
   df -h
   ```
   or
      ```sh
   mount
   ```
6. List files on the passed-through USB drive
   ```sh
   cd /mnt/crucial
   ls -al
   ``` 
## Set up `fstab` so the passed-through drive will mount on boot
1. Edit the `fstab` file
   ```sh
   sudo nano /etc/fstab
   ```
2. Add the following line
   ```EditorConfig
   /dev/vda1   /mnt/crucial   ext4    defaults     0        2
   ```
3. Test by mounting all file systems in `fstab`
   ```sh
   sudo mount -av
   ```
